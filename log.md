### Day 0: 2019-03-14

**Today's Progress:** Got file uploaded to astrobox with postman, reported bug on astrobox, tried to make astrobox print icon with javascript and python web server

**Thoughts:**
Poorly documented api's are the worst. This problem seems to be much easier than when I tackled it a year ago
