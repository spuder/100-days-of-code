**Today's Progress:** Created some pathetic CSS by hand for electron

**Thoughts:** Whats the correct way to edit CSS? Surely people aren't still doing this by hand are they?

### Day 6: 2019-03-20

**Today's Progress:** Got bash arrays working, wrote inotify script to watch directory for changes and uploads stl files to 3d printer

### Day 5: 2019-03-19

**Today's Progress:** Spent entire day troubleshooting bash arrays where input is a newline separated string. Works in tests, but not in prod. No idea why.

**Thoughts:** Torn between tweaking the code that I have, and wanting to complely overhaul and rewrite from scratch. Avoiding temptation to start over. I need to get better at fixing others code, not just writing my own.

### Day 0: 2019-03-14

**Today's Progress:** Got file uploaded to astrobox with postman, reported bug on astrobox, tried to make astrobox print icon with javascript and python web server

**Thoughts:**
Poorly documented api's are the worst. This problem seems to be much easier than when I tackled it a year ago
